# Strava Club Frontend

A frontent web app for displaying activities and leader boards in a Strava Club, hosted at https://main.d1t50jaanpdmjs.amplifyapp.com. Contains a leader board page, where activities are aggregated. The leader board page is filtered by activity type, and can additionally be filtered by a date range.

The backend is a single JSON file in Azure, which is generated and updated by my [Strava Club Function App](https://github.com/iamlogand/strava-function-app).
