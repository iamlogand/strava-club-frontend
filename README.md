# Strava Club Frontend

A frontent web app for displaying activities and leader boards in a Strava Club, hosted at [www.autorekstravaclub.com](https://www.autorekstravaclub.com). Contains an activities page showing all activities and a leader board page, where activities are aggregated. The leader board page is filtered by activity type, and can additionally be filtered by a date range and by specific athletes.

The backend is a single JSON file in Azure, which is generated and updated by my [Strava Club Function App](https://github.com/iamlogand/strava-function-app).
